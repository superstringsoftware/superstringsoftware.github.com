We started [SuperstringSoftware](http://superstringsoftware.com) to do our part in changing the way software and 
services based on software are built and used. 
We firmly believe that software should be simple (= have only necessary features), fast, easy to use, and that any underlying complexity 
that allows achieving these goals should be completely hidden from the user.

We do that by working with teams all around the world that create [great apps for iPhone,](http://app-fields.com) 
[tools for promising new web frameworks](http://observatory.meteor.com) such as [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and work on building
next generation business software (which we can't talk about yet). Here, all of us sometimes blog about our experience working 
on these projects.

In case you were wondering why the [superstrings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory) reference: as they are believed to be the 
basic building blocks of, well, everything, they are the simplest thing possible, which is described with the most complicated math you could 
imagine. That's kind of what we want to achieve, on our incomparably lesser scale - build simple beautiful things with simple / complex building 
blocks which our users don't see or even suspect of their existence.
