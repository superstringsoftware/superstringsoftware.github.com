Today, we've pushed a minor update to [Observatory](http://observatory.meteor.com) that adds ability to clear logs, cleans up some code
and adds the fourth mode to Observatory panel when it does not overlay the main page but is attached in the very end. In order for this
to work you need to make sure logs_bootstrap template is right below the closing "body" tag. Leave your comments on where you want us 
to take Observatory further! Happy logging :)
