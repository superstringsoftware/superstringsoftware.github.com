Meteor team [just announced](http://meteor.com/blog/2012/10/17/meteor-050-authentication-user-accounts-new-screencast) 
that Meteor version 0.5.0 is out! It's very exciting news as the main update included in 0.5.0 is robust support for
authentication - key (and arguably only) piece that was missing from the public version of the framework to allow building
production apps. Now you can consider Meteor seriously for your projects - still will require lots of testing,
especially on the scalability side of things, but from all practical purposes you are probably good to use it. Especially
if ease of maintenance and development time is of essense.

And as usual, to help your Meteor development, check out the [Observatory package](http://observatory.meteor.com)
that makes logging and some meteor app internals inspection much easier :)
