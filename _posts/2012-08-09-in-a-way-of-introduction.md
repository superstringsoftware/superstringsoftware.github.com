Just to start things off, hi, I am J "Xray" Ho and SuperstringSoftware is a "lab"-type (think google labs, 
microsoft research etc - only much smaller obviously) establishment where developers from a couple of friendly
startups share their experience on building things. [Meteor](http://meteor.com), [haskell](http://haskell.org),
iOS development are among possible topics you can expect mixed with ramblings on building businesses from scratch
now and then.
